Afternnon :

Addition of a folder named v2 containing an updated version of the database work :
- A .pdf with the updated uml is contained so it's not a guessing game.
- june_hotel_administrationv2.backup.sql (sql database with data)
- june_hotel_administrationv2.sql (empty sql database)

The update is mostly the option of creating staff accounts and allowing to place different kind of beds at will in the rooms. Some corrections to data storage was also done.

Morning :

 in the main folder, added

june_hotel_administration.backup.sql
(sql database with data)

and

june_hotel_administration.sql
(empty sql database)

Both pdf are from workbench and are the most recent work

The image is made with dia and dates from the morning, so it's not as advanced and can be disregarded.
